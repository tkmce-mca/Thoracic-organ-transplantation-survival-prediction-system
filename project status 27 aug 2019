Searched about various feature selection algorithms.
Techniques for Feature Selection can be divided in two approaches: feature ranking and subset selection. 
In the first approach, features are ranked by some criteria and then features above a defined threshold are selected. 
In the second approach,one searches a space of feature subsets for the optimal subset.
Available Feature Ranking Techniques.
All the listed techniques below can be used to generate rank weights for features.
Chi-squared Filter
Correlation Filter
Entropy-Based Filter
Random Forest Filter



Instead of manually filtering the attributes we are planning to apply these techniques to filter our dataset.
