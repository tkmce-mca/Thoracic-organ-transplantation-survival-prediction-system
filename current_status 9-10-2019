Things which are completed:
                   
                           Dropped the plan for selecting the data pre-processing algorithms
                           So we filtered the current data set again manually
                           Now we have a dataset containing features list between the range 90 - 100
                           
               
Plan for the current week:
       
                          We are planning to implement one of the classification algorithms using the current filtered dataset 
                          Designing of user interface.
                          
                          
                        
Plan for the next week:
 
                         implementation of rest of algorithms,designing phase and database connection
                         
                         
Open issue :
         
                         Difficulty in implementation of algorithms due to the lack of awareness in algorithm implementation
