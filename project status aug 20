A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network that generates a
set of outputs from a set of inputs. An MLP is characterized by several layers of input 
nodes connected as a directed graph between the input and output layers. MLP uses backpropogation
for training the network. MLP is a deep learning method.
Neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system.
A neuron contains axon ,dendrites, synapses,cell body.
The mathematical model of the neuron is called Perceptron.
