Started studying about various feature extraction method

Chi-square Test for Feature Extraction: 
Chi-square test is used for categorical features in a dataset. We calculate Chi-square between each 
feature and the target and select the desired number of features with best Chi-square scores. 
It determines if the association between two categorical variables of the sample would reflect 
their real association in the population.


chi square score is given by = (observed frequency- expected frequency)^2/ expected frequency


Observed frequency = No. of observations of class
Expected frequency = No. of expected observations of class if there was no relationship between the feature and the target.
